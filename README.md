## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Download the project code to your local machine using Git.


2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    Set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

4. **Configure the Environment Variables**:
    Create a .env file in the root directory, and if you have the necessary credentials and configurations ready, add them securely to the file.


5. **Set Up the Database**:
    Apply database migrations to create the necessary tables:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    ```
