Fix Permissions for students in admin panel
Error handling - did it for some things, but django is overriding a lot of the things, and it's not working for everything

* Think like functionality for student/how helpful was he/she
* Hide secret key, database settings and private stuff from project and put it in .env file that should be ignored by GitHub - the lector said we can also use decouple library for that so i should look at it
